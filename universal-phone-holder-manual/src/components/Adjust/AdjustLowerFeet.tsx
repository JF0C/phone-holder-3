                Push the feet down until they contact the phone case.
                The phone should not be able to move anymore relative to the holder.
                <br />
                <br />
                Check again that the feet are aligned with the phone as described in step&nbsp;

                Meaning that the feet should still be at the same distance from the end of the rails and the curvatures match.
